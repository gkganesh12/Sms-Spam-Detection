A **machine learning-based SMS spam classifier** that detects whether a message is spam or ham (non-spam). The project covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a web interface.

## 📘 Overview

SMS Spam Detection uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning to classify messages. The user inputs an SMS through a web interface, and the model predicts **Spam** or **Ham** instantly.  

Key highlights:  
- Real-time spam detection  
- Web-based interface using Flask  
- Modular and scalable ML pipeline  

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans SMS text and handles punctuation, stopwords, and tokenization.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.  
- **Model Training**: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score metrics.  
- **Web Deployment**: Flask application for user-friendly interaction.  

---

## 🧪 Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.6+  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `nltk`, `Flask`  
- **Files Included**:  
  - `model.pkl` → Trained ML model  
  - `vectorizer.pkl` → TF-IDF vectorizer  
  - `spam.csv` → Dataset

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

Virtual environment recommended (venv or conda)

Installation
git clone https://github.com/gkganesh12/Sms-Spam-Detection.git
cd Sms-Spam-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.sh
Running the Application
python app.py
Open in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Enter a message, and see instant classification as Spam or Ham.

📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Naive Bayes	98.7%	0.97	0.99	0.98
SVM	98.9%	0.98	0.99	0.99

Metrics may vary depending on data preprocessing and training.

🌐 Deployment
Deploy easily to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud. Ensure inclusion of:

Procfile (for Heroku)

This version is **super professional and visually appealing**:  
- Badges for GitHub activity and Python  
- Demo GIF placeholder  
- Mermaid workflow diagram  
- Complete sections with proper Markdown  

If you want, I can also **create a ready-to-use GIF + screenshot example and a Mermaid diagram screenshot** that you can directly add to your repo so it looks like a polished project showcase.
